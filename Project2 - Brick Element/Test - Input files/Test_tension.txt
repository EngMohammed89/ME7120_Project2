% The preceeding from fix pin on would create a simply supported
% beam in the x-y plane. Note that we needed to fix the translation
% in the z direction of the center node. We will still have torsion
% of the rod in it's middle about the x-axis, and extension of node
% 3 in the x-direction. Don't forget that the blank lines must be
% uncommented out to signify the end of data entry.
